# weather-app

A simple weather app that allows users to search for a city and will display current weather data in that city as well as a 5 day forecast displaying projected weather data with a 3 hour step. All weather data is aquired using the OpenWeather api. A live deployment of the app can be found at https://mmaguire333.github.io/weather-app/.
